- draw numbers across all boards until  the win of the last board.
    possible implementations:
        - go through all numbers to draw and collect list of winning boards; take head of that list
        - count number of boards that win and return boards that wins at *number of boards* time
            drawNumberUntilFirstPossibleWin then remove board that wins until we get 

Apparently not all boards wins, so we need no to take the last remained board as last winning one.
So we could say only when we get through the all of the number to draw which board wins last.

Why drawNumberUntilLastPossibleWin' with boardWithStateMap' missing some marked numbers coordinates from the boardWithStateMap and otherwise?
