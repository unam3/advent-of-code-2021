Map (Int, Int) (Int {- Value -}, Bool {- IsMarked -}

Need to be able to check if any column or row of the border is marked

How to go through board cells and get their values?

---

1) get draw number
-- for all boards
2) mark all numbers on the board that equals draw number
    get it position and add to boardMap
3) if we have a column or a row of marked numbers
    3.1) board wins:
        sum all unmarked numbers on the board
            (if keys of map count > 12 can optimize)
        multiply that sum by the number that was just called
    3.2) otherwise repeat
