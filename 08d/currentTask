+ how to get 3
    + update output of defiving functions
    + diff all numbers that we know and get only 0, 2 and 3 representations
    + filter out 3 from them: only 3 don't have BL.
+ derive 2 and 0:
    + 5 \\ 3 \\ top right segment to get top left segment
    + zeroTwoThree \\ three = zeroTwo. Two has no top left segment, but zero does.
- decode the four-digit output values
- add up all of the output values
