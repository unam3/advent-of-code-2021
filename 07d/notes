LESSONS

1. Run tests with real input to solve puzzle instead of running it in ghci (very expensive) or modifying stack project
to run it witch stack exec.

2. Premature optimization is wrong: type CrabsMap = IntMap (NumberOfCrabsMapInThisPosition, Maybe Fuel)
I never have used second part of the tuple.
