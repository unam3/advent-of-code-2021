+ what data structures should be used?
    + Map
+ implement simulateStep
    + implement adjacent levels increase
    + implement filterIncreaseLoop function which is recursive
    + count total flashes
    + implement zero
    + add tests
        + first step
        + 2 steps for bigger test input
+ implement n-steps support for simulateStep
+ given the starting energy levels of the dumbo octopuses in your cavern, simulate N steps and count number of total flashes.

Part 2. What is the first step during which all octopuses flash?

+ How we can find it out?
    + check all the values of the EnergyLevels map.
        does not require modification of simulateStep
        potentially less performant

    x count number of flashes at the end of the step: length octopusesThatFlashesThisStep.
        ! require modification of simulateStep
        - pass a break function into simulateStep
