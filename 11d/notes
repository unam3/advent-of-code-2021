+ what data structures should be used?
    + Map
+ implement simulateStep
    + implement adjacent levels increase
    + implement filterIncreaseLoop function which is recursive
    + count total flashes
    + implement zero
    + add tests
        + first step
        + 2 steps for bigger test input
+ implement n-steps support for simulateStep
- given the starting energy levels of the dumbo octopuses in your cavern, simulate N steps and count number of total flashes.
