+ what data structures should be used?
    + Map
- implement simulateStep
    + implement adjacent levels increase
    + implement filterIncreaseLoop function which is recursive
    + count total flashes
    + implement zero
    - add tests
- given the starting energy levels of the dumbo octopuses in your cavern, simulate N steps and count number of total flashes.
