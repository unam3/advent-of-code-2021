â€¢ parse input into transparent paper and fold instructions representation
    + split input into 2 segments
        - write custom function
        + ~~2 filters~~ partition (isPrefixOf "fold")
        - splitAt . (!!) (isPrefixOf "fold")
        x span/break
    + parse "x,y" strings into a Vector (Int, Int)
        x add "(", ")" and read them into [(Int, Int)], then fromList
        + replace comma with whitespace, run words, construct tuples; run fromList
    + parse fold instructions into FoldInstruction
    - verify parsing by comparing visualition of TransparentPaper with puzzle's one
        - implement visualizeTransparentPaper

- implement folding paper function: foldPaper
How many dots are visible after completing just the first fold instruction on transparent paper?
